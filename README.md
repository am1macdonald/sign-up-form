# Sign Up Form Project

Thanks for stopping by my Signup Form Project

## About

This project was completed as part of the ["Odin Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

My form is strongly based on the model provided as part of the challenge, but with a few personal touches.

## Technologies

This is my first project using 'Sass'!

Otherwise, the Signup page was built with HTML5 and Vanilla Javascript.
